# Shahla Atapoor Project on Data Mining Course
# Your mobile can recognize your physical activity! 
### This is a README file for my Project in the Data Mining course at University of Tartu. Currently I am working alone on the porject. 

#### My data set is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/vmalyi/run-or-walk

### Goal of the Project:
#### Goal 1: Get more acquaintance with data mining processes behind Samsung S-Health system 
#### Goal 2: Recognize physical activity of a person using sensor data of his mobile phone  (accelerometer and gyroscope)  

Being motivated in the S Helath application of my Samsung Note 4 mobile phone, I get interested to learn more about data processing of this healthcare application. One step further, I am eager to see do we can use gathered data by mobile sensors to predict our physical activities. In this project, data are collected by accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Physical activities refer to activities such as running, walking and etc.
